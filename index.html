                <p class="intro">Charles Babbage (1791-1871) was an English mathematician, philosopher, inventor, and mechanical engineer who originated the concept of a programmable computer. Often called the "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs.</p>
                <p>His work was truly revolutionary for the Victorian era, envisioning computational machines that wouldn't be realized for more than a century after his lifetime.</p>

            <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
            <p>Although Babbage's machines were not built during his lifetime, his ideas profoundly influenced the development of modern computing. In the 20th century, engineers studying his plans realized that his analytical engine would have worked if constructed with the technology of his time.</p>
            <p>Today, Babbage is widely respected as a visionary who saw the potential of mechanized computation long before electronics made it practical. The programming language "Ada" is named after his collaborator Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p>
